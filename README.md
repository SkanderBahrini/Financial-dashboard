# Financial-dashboard

This project aims to create a financial dashboard containing Yahoo Finance stock information.

In this project, we used many Python libraries such as :

+ Ploltly
+ Pandas
+ Streamlit
+ Yahoo Finance

This project is composed of 4 tabs:

* Tab1: Display company info
* Tab2: Display company summary
* Tab3: Display company chart
* Tab4: Compared between companies' stocks


# First step:
The client needs to enter company Ticker and the desired interval period.
