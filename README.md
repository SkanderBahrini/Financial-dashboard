# Financial-dashboard

This project aims to create a financial dashboard containing Yahoo Finance stock information.

In this project, we used many Python libraries such as :

+ Ploltly
+ Pandas
+ Streamlit
+ Yahoo Finance

This project is composed of 4 tabs:

* Tab1: Display company info
* Tab2: Display company summary
* Tab3: Display company chart
* Tab4: Compared between companies' stocks

# â›” Important Notice 

If you want to retrieve data directly from Yahoo Finance you will face this problem:

Yahoo is blocking you and does not allow data retrieval.

# ðŸ’¡ Solution

To avoid this problem you need to use Yahoo Finance API:

API will provide to Yahoo Finance:

+ User-Agent: This will allow the website to authenticate the user by providing a web browser and it is version and type of operating system used.

  example: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64)

+ Cookie: A cookie will allow the website to remember the user on each visit

+ Crumb: It is a token that will protect the user from Cross-site forgery which is a cyber attack that will execute a command on behalf of the user. By using this token we will ensure that each command executed comes from a trusted part.
